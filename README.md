    <h1> # Task3_L2: GEOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS</h1>

üöÄI'm excited to share my Task-3 (Level 2): GEOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS in the Data Analysis Internship Program with Cognifyz Technologies!

<h2>üîπProject Overview:</h2>

In this project, I analyzed a given restaurant dataset to explore insights on:
1. Plot the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates.
2. Identify any pattrns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

<h2>üîπ Key Insights: </h2>
After performing a thorough analysis, here are the findings:<br>
<h2>DBSCAN Clustering of Restaurant Locations</h2>

1. Dense restaurant clusters: Restaurants in close proximity (e.g., city centers, food streets) are grouped together with the same cluster label, appearing in the same color.
2. Isolated restaurants: Restaurants far from others are marked as noise (-1 cluster label), appearing differently or as isolated dots.
3. Multiple hotspots: Separate clusters can represent distinct restaurant hubs in areas like markets, office districts, schools, or downtown areas.

Visual Representation
DBSCAN Clustering of Restaurant Locations is shown in the figure:

- X-axis: Longitude<br>
- Y-axis: Latitude<br>
- Colored dots: DBSCAN cluster labels (0-18)<br>
- Gray dots (-1): Noise or outliers (restaurants not in any cluster)<br>

This plot provides valuable insights into the geographic distribution and clustering of restaurants in the area.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏èTools & Technologies Used:</h2><br>

To achieve this Task3 of level 2, I used the following tools and technologies:<br>

1. Python ‚Äì used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy ‚Äì used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas ‚Äì used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib ‚Äì used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn ‚Äì used for advanced statistical data visualization
5. *Scikit-learn*:
    - *DBSCAN*: Density-based clustering
    - *StandardScaler*: Feature scaling (standardization).
7. Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

Why DBSCAN instead of K-Means?
1. Density-based clustering: DBSCAN groups data points based on density, not just distance.
2. Arbitrary cluster shapes: DBSCAN can identify clusters of varying shapes, whereas K-Means prefers circular shapes.
3. Noise detection: DBSCAN automatically identifies outliers (noise) that don't belong to any cluster.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.<br><br>
üéâ I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and sharpen my data analysis skills. <br>Thank you to Cognifyz Technologies for this amazing learning experience! I'm excited to continue growing and taking on new challenges.<br><br>

<p>I hope this will be very helpful to new learners and students. <br>
And I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! <br>
Let's connect and explore more data-driven insights together. <br><br>
Thank you all!
