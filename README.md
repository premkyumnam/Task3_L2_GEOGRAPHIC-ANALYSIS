    <h1> # Task3_L2: GEOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS</h1>

🚀I'm excited to share my Task-3 (Level 2): GEOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS in the Data Analysis Internship Program with Cognifyz Technologies!

<h2>🔹Project Overview:</h2>

In this project, I analyzed a given restaurant dataset to explore insights on:
1. Identify the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset and
2. Determine if certain cuisines combinations tend to have higher ratings.

<h2>🔹 Key Insights: </h2>
After performing a thorough analysis, here are the findings:<br>
<h2>DBSCAN Clustering of Restaurant Locations</h2>

This scatter plot shows restaurant clusters based on locations, with:
- X-axis: Longitude
- Y-axis: Latitude
- Colored dots: DBSCAN cluster labels (0-18)
- Gray dots (-1): Noise or outliers (restaurants not in any cluster)
Each cluster groups restaurants that are geographically close."

<h2>🛠️Tools & Technologies Used:</h2><br>

To achieve this Task3 of level 2, I used the following tools and technologies:<br>

1. Python – used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy – used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas – used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib – used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn – used for advanced statistical data visualization
6. Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.<br><br>
🎉 I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and sharpen my data analysis skills. <br>Thank you to Cognifyz Technologies for this amazing learning experience! I'm excited to continue growing and taking on new challenges.<br><br>
